During phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a vesicle called a phagosome. Lysosomes then fuse with the phagosome, delivering enzymes that degrade the bacterium. Ubiquitination is the process of adding a ubiquitin molecule to a protein, which can target the protein for degradation by the proteasome. However, in the context of phagocytosis, ubiquitination of phagosomal proteins is not well-studied and the available evidence is limited. One study found that ubiquitination of phagosomal proteins occurred during the clearance of apoptotic cells, but not during the phagocytosis of bacteria (1). Another study found that ubiquitination of phagosomal proteins was involved in the regulation of phagosome-lysosome fusion (2). Therefore, while ubiquitination of phagosomal proteins may occur in some contexts, it is not a general feature of phagocytosis."",

Recall any existing knowledge or research regarding the computational prediction of MoRFs in IDPs. 3. Analyze the provided context for any relevant information. In the context, we find that bioinformatics methods are used to analyze amino acid sequences that genes encode, searching for disordered regions based on their unusually low hydrophobicity and relatively high net charge. Additionally, proteomics research combines computer-based bioinformatics tools with robotics and other technologies to investigate proteins, including IDPs. 4.

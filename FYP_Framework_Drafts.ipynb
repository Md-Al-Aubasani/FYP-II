            "Content: First aid includes horizontal positioning (especially if there are cerebral manifestations), intravenous fluids if available, and sustained 100% oxygen administration. The latter accelerates inert gas washout from tissues and promotes resolution of bubbles. Definitive treatment of DCS or CAGE with recompression and hyperbaric oxygen is justified in most instances, although some mild or marginal DCS cases may be managed with first aid measures, an option that may be invoked under various circumstances, but especially if evacuation for recompression is hazardous or extremely difficult. Long-distance evacuations are usually undertaken using a helicopter flying at low altitude or a fixed wing air ambulance pressurized to 1 atmosphere pressure.\n",

            "Content: The recognition that much of the morbidity and mortality are determined at the scene of an injury has stimulated the development of prevention measures. The Haddon matrix combines the epidemiologic components (host, agent, physical and social environments) with time factors (before, during, and after the event) to identify effective interventions focused on different aspects of the injury event. Primary strategies (preventing the event), secondary strategies (minimizing the severity of injury), and tertiary strategies (minimizing longterm impact) can be targeted for each epidemiologic component. Such strategies typically fall into one of three areas: education, enforcement, and environment (including engineering). Education is often the first strategy considered but requires behavioral change and actions on the part of people. Most educational strategies are not well evaluated.\n"
